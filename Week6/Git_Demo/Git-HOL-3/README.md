# Git Hands-on 3

## Objective

Learn Git branching and merging by creating a new branch, making changes, comparing branches, merging the branch into the main branch, and deleting the merged branch.

---

## Steps Completed

- Initialized a local Git repository.
- Created the initial file `welcome.txt`.
- Committed the initial version to the `main` branch.
- Created a new branch named `GitNewBranch`.
- Switched to the new branch.
- Modified the `welcome.txt` file.
- Committed the changes in `GitNewBranch`.
- Verified the repository status.
- Switched back to the `main` branch.
- Compared the differences between `main` and `GitNewBranch`.
- Merged `GitNewBranch` into the `main` branch.
- Viewed the commit history using the Git log graph.
- Deleted the merged branch.
- Connected the local repository to GitHub.
- Successfully pushed the repository to GitHub.
